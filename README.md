# Aluvion_control_pump

Aluvion control pump is an ideal PLC for motor control.
Based on ESP32 microcontroller, it can control up to three motors. 

Characteristics:
-Power supply 12-80VDC
  Three outputs with 16A relays
  240VAC/30VDC.
-Three forced start inputs
-Three hydrolevel type probes
-Ampere reading, to protect the motors

In this example we will use it to control 3 24VDC water pumps, located in a well and with solar panels.
